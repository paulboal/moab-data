## 1. Remove Geometric Means

_I marked up the output spreadsheet from the program. The number one thing I'd like is to completely remove the geometric averaging throughout. (That is 100% my fault for using the wrong word on day 1). In the glossary tab I just wrote some changes in red._

_Points Tab I think everything is fine (and I don't know how you sorted each point into its proper SU and cell number, but that is AWESOME! and AMAZING!) Subcells, I'd like to remove the reading_gmean column, and the associated diff column. That would leave this tab as sorting each data point into its SU, Cell, then Subcell, and the reading count for each subcell, and the reading_mean (the subcell arithmetic average of the readings that land in the subcell). For the cells tab, pull the red columns (geometric mean items)._


## 2. Review Highlighted Items
_Then I highlighted in orange a few that have something weird If what I've taken as the values is correct I'm not sure why the large discrepancy. I put some notes in._

The orange rows are those where there's a big difference between the manually calculated difference and the difference I provided. The reason for this is that my calculation was simply a percent difference between the point-based mean and the subcell-based mean.  That is, my calculation was:

$$\frac{Point\_mean - Subcell\_mean}{Subcell\_mean}$$

The calculation done in the spreadsheet is the percent difference between the point-based mean and the average of the point-based mean and subcell-based mean:

$$\frac{Point\_mean - Subcell\_mean}{\frac{Point\_mean + Subcell\_mean}{2}}$$

Happy to change my calculation if you feel that's a more appropriate way to understand the difference, but I think my calculation is most appropriate for expressing the magnitude of the difference between the two calculations.
