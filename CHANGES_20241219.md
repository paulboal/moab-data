## 1. Grid Hierarchy Terminology Change

_Item one is simply a terminology change. Where we have SU in the columns (e.g. LK or LL) That is actually called the "Tile ID".  The number within the tile is the SU (we have that identified as "Cell"). So in the resulting spreadsheet on points the column headings would be Northing, Easting, reading, Tile, SU, Subcell. On the Subcells Tab, It would Say Tile, SU, Subcell, reading_mean, Reading g_mean, Reading count, diff. The cells tab would make the column headings Tile, SU, subcell_gmean, subcelll_mean, subcell_count, reading_count, gmean_diff, point_mean, point_count, point_diff._

* 1.1 Change references to "Survey Unit" or "SU" to "Tile" throughout the code
* 1.2 Change references to "Cell" to "Survey Unit" (SU) throughout the code
* 1.3 Update all spreadsheet notes


## 2. Remove References to State Plane (SP)

_The other thing I'd like to change is in the code. The coordinates aren't actually State Plane. They are US survey foot, but we work on ground, not projection out here (so 1' is 1 foot on ground, rather than on grid projection/geoid). Because of this, there is scale, rotation, and shift (translation) from our local coordinates to the State Plane coordinates (about 1.2 degrees rotation, 300 to 600 feet of shift, with a combined scale factor somewhere around 0.9999XXX). Anyhow, it doesn't matter, we work solely in our project coordinates and I can move those using Trimble Business Center to SP if needed. The main thing is, can we change the code/notes to say this is on Local Coordinates (Modified State Plane) rather than SPC UTC Zone C-4302? (If you drop our coordinates into say Google Earth or something, everything is going to hit to the north of where it ought to and be slightly out of kilter. I don't believe there's any calculation difference on this, it's just that I don't want to confuse anyone along the way with thinking we're in a Sp coordinate system._

* 2.1 Remove refences to SPC in the documentation and say "US survey foot" or something else instead
